## Overview

## Business Use Case
1. Sales Territory Planning
  * Determine if any targeted location can easily be accessed.

## Inputs

1. World Airports - Source: [Ourairports.com](http://ourairports.com/data/)
2. Zipcodes - Source: [AggData.con](https://www.aggdata.com/free/united-states-zip-codes)


## Output
1. CSV file per state/region, which contains the following:
  * All zipcodes
  * Nearest airport (code, lat and long) of each zipcode


## Notes

  1. Nearest distance is based on [Haversine](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41336756/find-the-closest-latitude-and-longitude) formula

## Sample Data: 90210, California

_Out of **558 airports** in California, what's the nearest airport to **Beverly Hills, LA**?_


| zipcode| country | state| state_full| county| latitude-zip| longitude-zip|  
| ---- | ---- |---- | ----  | ---- | ---- | ---- |  
| 90210	| US	| CA	| California| 	Los Angeles | 34.0901	| -118.4065|  

<br><br>

Based on the script, the nearest airport to 90210 is: KSMO is **Santa Monica Municipal Airport**

| nearest-airport	| latitude-air | longitude-air|distance (km)|  
| ---- | ---- |---- | ----  |   
| KSMO	| 34.01580048	| -118.4509964| 	9.222835746 |  

<br><br>

Let's validate the model by plotting in Google Maps:

* The black line indicates the distance of 9.20 km from 90210 to the airport, which is close to 9.22km!

* Note that the formula doesn't consider the actual roads in the location. Haversine simply calculates the distance from point A to point B.

Now, here's the second nearest airport: Bob Hope Airport (KBUR)

| nearest-airport	| latitude-air |   longitude-air|distance (km)|  
| ---- | ---- |---- | ----  |  
|KBUR	|34.20069885	|-118.3590012|	13.05176636|


![Nearest Airport](Assets/la-kbur.png)

* Distance based on Haversine: 13.05 km  
* Distance based on Google Maps 13.03 km


## Possible Enhancements

  1. Add Part 2: travelability scores through Pandas binning
